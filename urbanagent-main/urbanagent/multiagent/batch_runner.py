"""G6–G7: ordered submit to sandbox; collect outcomes.

Bridge × Agent Protocol v1.0 has `command_status` events drive completion, so
``sandbox.send_action`` already blocks until a terminal status (or ``ongoing``).
There is no longer a need to poll ``CityState`` to confirm that an action took
effect — terminal status implies the world matches.
